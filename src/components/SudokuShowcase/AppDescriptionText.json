    "line1": "My current personal project is an Androidâ„¢ application called Sudoku Mobile. Sudoku Mobile is built using React Native, Redux and Expo. It uses my own npm package to generate the puzzles.",
    "line2": "It's free and does not contain any ads - for now - so if you like Sudoku or just puzzle games in general, give it a try! Please note that Sudoku Mobile is still in beta. Some performance improvements, additional features, an optional dark theme and other creature comforts and are still on the way!"
